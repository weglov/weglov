- 👨‍💻 I’m Software engineer with a strong passion for well-written code and high-quality UIs. Since entering the web development field in 2012, I have served as a Frontend Technical lead and architect. Product thinking is an integral part of my approach. I strive to find win-win scenarios, where empathy often serves as a useful tool.
